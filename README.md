# Devjobs web app

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I am doing another frontend challenge to build out jobs board using local `data.json` to retrieve the data. My goal is to try to get
my project looking as close to the design as possible. So to accomplish this task i will use react-bootstrap, react-router-dom and 
loadable-components.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Be able to filter jobs on the index page by title, location, and whether a job is for a full-time position
- Be able to click a job from the index page so that they can read more information and apply for the job

the live app is available on
